						<p>When it comes to product collaborations, Galore's fans turn up. Working with Missguided, the Galore creative team designed a 20-piece collection inspired by Lil' Kim, and shot and produced all of the creative assets including the lookbook, bts video, a kit of social assets, in addition to getting the clothes on celebrities like Paris Hilton and Keke Palmer, and pushed out to our Kitten influencers and Galore Girls. Result....the collection sold out in 2 Weeks.</p>

						<h2 class="">Experiential</h2>
						<p>With Instagram turning events into media moments (and the pull of Netflix keeping people at home), unique experiential moments are more important than ever. Either through music driven events like Galore Fashion Week, Miami SWIM, Sisterhood of Sound, or our new music Festival Girl Cult, Galore brings a creative and fun approach to live events, which are always attended by the most sought after names in our target demo.</p>
